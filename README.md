# Use React with Django Ninja (including Auth) in 15 mins ⚡️

We'll create a full-stack application using React.js frontend and a Django REST API, using the awesome Django Ninja (Much nicer than Django REST framework), including user authentication.

I'll also show you 5 things that you'll want to do when adding auth:

1. How to add page routing (using React Router) to your React.js frontend
2. How to add centralized state management to React using Zustand (another excellent, well-designed package)
3. How to add persistent state (e.g., refreshing the page and still being logged in) using simple local storage
4. How to register new users
5. Secure and simple auth using Django's in-built session authentication


React and Django Ninja are an excellent combination. Let's start! 🏎
